            <h3>Early Life</h3>
            <p>Kubrick was born on July 26, 1928, in Manhattan, New York City, to a Jewish family. At Stanley's birth the Kubricks lived in the Bronx. His parents married in a Jewish ceremony, but Kubrick did not have a religious upbringing and later professed an atheistic view of the universe.<br><br>His IQ was discovered to be above average but his attendance was poor. He displayed an interest in literature from a young age and began reading Greek and Roman myths and the fables of the Grimm brothers, which "instilled in him a lifelong affinity with Europe".<br><br>When Kubrick was 13, his father bought him a Graflex camera, triggering a fascination with still photography. He befriended a neighbor, Marvin Traub, who shared his passion for photography.

            <h3>Photographic Career</h3>
            <p>While in high school, Kubrick was chosen as an official school photographer. In the mid-1940s, since he was unable to gain admission to day session classes at colleges, he briefly attended evening classes at the City College of New York. Eventually, he sold a photographic series to Look magazine, which was printed on June 26, 1945.<br><br>In 1946, he became an apprentice photographer for Look and later a full-time staff photographer. Kubrick quickly became known for his story-telling in photographs. His first, published on April 16, 1946, was entitled <i>"A Short Story from a Movie Balcony"</i> and staged a fracas between a man and a woman, during which the man is slapped in the face, caught genuinely by surprise.

            <h3>Personal Life</h3>
            <p>During the production of <i>Paths of Glory</i> (1957) in Munich, Kubrick met and romanced young German actress Christiane Harlan, who played a small though memorable role. Kubrick married Harlan in 1958, and in 1959 they settled into a home in Beverly Hills with Harlan's daughter, Katharina, Besides his stepdaughter, they had two daughters together, Anya and Vivian.<br><br>Kubrick moved to the UK to make <i>“Lolita”</i> because of the freedom from censorship and interference from Hollywood studios. There he set up his life so that family and business were combined.<br><br>Christiane Kubrick told the London Times how rough New York had become, with children having to be escorted to school by police, people being rude, and smashed glass all over the street.  Although he thrived on the manic energy of New York, Kubrick soon adapted to the more genteel atmosphere of Britain.Stanley and his wife remained together 40 years, until his death in 1999.

            <p>On March 7, 1999, six days after screening a final cut of <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i> for his family and the stars, Kubrick died in his sleep at the age of 70, suffering a heart attack. His funeral was held five days later at Childwickbury Manor, with only close friends and family in attendance, totaling about 100 people. The media were kept a mile away outside the entrance gate.<br><br>He was buried next to his favorite tree on the estate. In her book dedicated to Kubrick, his wife Christiane included one of his favorite quotations of Oscar Wilde: "The tragedy of old age is not that one is old but that one is young.”

            <h3>Legacy</h3>
            <p>Part of the New Hollywood film-making wave, Kubrick's films are considered by film historian Michel Ciment to be "among the most important contributions to world cinema in the twentieth century", and he is frequently cited as one of the greatest and most influential directors in the history of cinema. Leading directors, including Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, Wes Anderson, George Lucas, James Cameron, have cited Kubrick as a source of inspiration.<br><br>Kubrick is widely referenced in popular culture; for example, the TV series The Simpsons is said to contain more references to Kubrick films than any other pop culture phenomenon. When the Directors Guild of Great Britain gave Kubrick a lifetime achievement award, they included a cut-together sequence of all the homages from the show.<br><br>Artists in fields other than film have also expressed admiration for Kubrick. English musician and poet PJ Harvey; the music video for Kanye West's 2010 song <i>"Runaway"</i> was inspired by <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i>; Pop singer Lady Gaga's concert shows have included the use of dialogue, costumes, and music from <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>.
